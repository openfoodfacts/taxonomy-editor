### Add tests

We need more test to augment our coverage.
Feel free to either add unit or integration tests.

### Write Documentation

Taxonomy Editor needs a lot of documentation,
whether in docs/ folder or in docstrings.

### Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at
<https://github.com/openfoodfacts/taxonomy-editor/issues>.

If you are proposing a feature:

- Explain in detail how it would work.
- Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
- Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are welcome.

## Get Started!

Ready to contribute code? Here's how to set up Taxonomy Editor for local development.

1.  Fork the taxonomy-editor repo on GitHub.
2.  Clone your fork locally:

    ```
    git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/taxonomy-editor.git
    ```
3. Follow [install documentation](./doc/introduction/setup-dev.md)

4. code!

5. TODO: add explanations about linting / checks / tests when we have automated them.

6.  Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

    ```
    git status
    git add files-you-have-modified
    git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
    ```

    In brief, commit messages should follow these conventions:

    > - Always start using 
        [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) 
        prefix, e.g. "fix: ..." or "feat: ..."
    > - Always contain a subject line which briefly describes the changes made. For example "fix: fixed typo in CONTRIBUTING.md".
    > - Subject lines should not exceed 50 characters, but you can add more line after
    > - The commit body should contain context about the change - how the code worked before,
        how it works now and why you decided to solve the issue in the way you did.
